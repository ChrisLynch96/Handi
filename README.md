# Handi

Software Engineering project from 2nd year.

### Idea
Our group was tasked with developing a prototype Android application for a student start-up in Trinity College, Dublin. It was meant as a proof of concept and demostration tool to prospective investors. The premise was an application to connect local "Handymen" with customers who require a job, similar to UBER.
